<li> Water management techniques: monitoring soil moisture and using weather data to determune optimal irrigation timing and amount.</li>
<li> Onion variety selection: choosing varieties suited to the local climate and irrigation methods.</li>
<li> Training for farmers.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Potential benefits</h4>
<oltype="1">
 <li>Higher onion yields</li>
 <li>Reduced water usage</li>
 <li>Improved onion quality</li>
 <li>Increased farmer income</li>
</ol>
<p2>The preject could be led by agricultural research institutions, government agencies, or private organizations.<br> It would likely target farmers looking to improve their onion production and profitability</p2>
